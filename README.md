# aws-cf-templates
This repo contains templates for CloudFront. This is AWS' (Amazon Web Services) 'Infrastructe as a Code' service.

The templates are written in YAML ('YAML Ain't Markup Language', http://yaml.org). I prefer this language over JSON because it is easier to write and edit. CloudFront supports both.
